## Introduction
This project aims to analyze online retail data to identify customer segments using K-Means clustering. The tutorial by TrentDoesMath provides a step-by-step guide to achieve this.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail dataset, which contains transactional data of a UK-based online retailer.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k_means.git
cd k_means
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The analysis is detailed in the Jupyter notebook `data_clustering.ipynb`. To run the notebook, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook data_clustering.ipynb
```

## Results
The analysis of the online retail data using K-Means clustering reveals distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. The results are visualized using scatter plots and bar charts in the notebook.
